# goodolddownloads-deobf
Deobfuscate https://goggames.goodolddownloads.com/ links.

## How?

Call `node deobf.js` with the link to deobfuscate, `dank`, and `memes`, in that order.

Alternatively, if you have a [full folder of saved game pages](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ckhj7yca5zxtq2/gamepages.zip?dl=0), you can modify and use ðŸ’– kaylee ðŸ’–'s `extract.sh` script.

For more instruxions, see relevant files's headers.

## Why?

It was just really rewarding to reverse-engineer the algorithm tbh, also, in immortal words of "lesbians, what is ur wisdom" meme: *girl hot*.
